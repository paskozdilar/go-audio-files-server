# go-audio-files-server

Serves common audio files via simple HTML5 form so that they can be played by
any modern browser.

## TODO

- [ ] Verify list of audio formats supported by browsers
- [ ] Use fsnotify to watch for changes in the audio files directory instead of
      traversing the directory every time
- [ ] Add CSS to make it look better
